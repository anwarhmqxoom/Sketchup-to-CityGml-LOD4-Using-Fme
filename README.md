# Sketchup to CityGml LOD4 Using Fme
the highest level of accuracy and resolution for the indoor building, is to a certain extent equivalent to the LoD4 defined in CityGML 2.0. This level has the most comprehensive and detailed structures of interior installations and furniture, whose geometry may be given using an explicit geometry bounded by a _BoundarySurface or an implicitGeometry object. This level is beneficial to the virtual accessibility to building models, such as for visitor information in a museum, Moreover, for realistic effect, even texture would be attached; the indoor analyses that require more finely detailed geometries and semantics are allowable


CityGML


City Geography Mark-up Language (CityGML) is a recent standard developed to describe, store and exchange virtual 3D city models. It is based on extensible Mark-up Language (XML) and represents geometric as well as semantic attributes of a virtual 3D city model. Additionally,  it provides functionality to represent the scale of specific object with the help of five level of details .  
1.	LOD0 represents the digital terrain model.
2.	LOD1 represents the building models as flat-roofed blocks.
3.	LOD2 represents the building models with distinct roof structures.
4.	LOD3 represents the architectural models with more details including walls, roofs.
5.	LOD4 represents architectural models with interior structures along with LOD3


SketchUp 


Sketchup, formerly Google Sketchup, is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, film and video game design. It is available as a web-based application, SketchUp Free, a freeware version, SketchUp Make, and a paid version with additional functionality, SketchUp Pro.

FME


The Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) is a platform that streamlines the translation of spatial data between geometric and digital formats. It is intended especially for use with geographic information system (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD) and raster graphics software. The platform was originally developed by Safe Software, Inc. of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. The FME is useful in applications involving interactive geographical, geological and topographical mapping, such as Google Earth and MapQuest. It facilitates the transformation of spatial data into a variety of formats, data models and repositories for transmission to end users. This process is called spatial extract, transform and load (spatial ETL). Key features of the FME include: Spatial data migration among multiple sites. Consolidation of data from diverse sources. Distribution of data to multiple users. Transformation of data between programs from diverse vendors. Data transfer to and from Web sites. Developer tools. Coordinate conversion support.
